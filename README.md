# About me 
Hello there! I am Dinuka Sandun Udayantha. I hold a first-class honors degree in Biomedical Engineering from the Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering at the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. My university journey began in 2020 following my exceptional performance in the G.C.E Advance Level examination in the Physical Science stream, where I achieved a ranking in the top 1% nationwide. I am presently serving as a teaching assistant at the Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering.

I am a dynamic individual with a strong educational foundation. My research interests and experience are focused on the AI domain. I am keen on acquiring new technological knowledge and leveraging my expertise to explore novel research areas within the AI domain. My undergraduate final-year thesis, titled _"An AI-Powered Wireless EEG Amplifier for Detecting Neonatal Seizures,"_ was completed under the guidance of Dr. Chamira Edussooriya, Dr. Anjula De Silva, and Prof. Jithangi Wanigasinghe.
