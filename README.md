# About me 
Hello there! I am Dinuka Sandun Udayantha. I hold a first-class honors degree in Biomedical Engineering from the Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering at the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. My university journey began in 2020 following my exceptional performance in the G.C.E Advance Level examination in the Physical Science stream, where I achieved a ranking in the top 1% nationwide. I am presently serving as a teaching assistant at the Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering.

I am a dynamic individual with a sound educational background. My research interest and experience align with the AI domain, as well as I am eager to learn new technology and apply my knowledge to explore new research areas in the AI domain. I completed my undergraduate final-year thesis _"An AI-powered wireless EEG amplifier for detecting neonatal seizures"_ with Dr. Chamira Edussooriya Dr. Anjula De Silva, and Prof. Jithangi Wanigasinghe.
